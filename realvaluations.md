# âž• RealValuations

Separate of, and often as a precursor to, Ecological Ensurance, we conduct natural capital valuations on ecosystems and properties around the world using the [RealValue of Natural Capital](https://docs.basin.global/realvalue/why-put-a-value-on-nature) Framework.  These "RealValuations" appear here.
