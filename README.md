# âš¡ Ecological Ensurance Overview

**BASIN's Ecological Ensurance** offers a direct approach to protect and regenerate ecosystems. Utilizing collective efforts, this model is designed to preserve, restore, and steward natural assets through the [BASIN Protocol](https://docs.basin.global/protocol/the-value-gap), ensuring long-term ecological conservation.

## Ensurance Binder: Slips and Policies

The BASIN Ensurance Binder acts as a central hub for both potential and active ecological protection agreements. The Binder features two main elements: Slips and Policies.

### **Ensurance Slips**

Slips detail ecological polygons (EPs) identified for Ensurance. These are unique ecosystems or legally defined properties poised for ecological coverage under the [RealValue of Natural Capital](http://realvalue.basin.global/) framework. In Slip status, stakeholders can buy Certificates of Ensurance for broad ecological contributions, including ecosystems, bioregions, and specific species. Direct ensurance of a polygon becomes possible once transitioned to Policy status.

### **Ensurance Policies**

Transitioning from a Slip to an Ensurance Policy occurs when an EP is underwritten and an Ensurer pledges protection. This marks a formal commitment, enabling the issue of Certificates of Ensurance specific to the property, solidifying the dedication to safeguard the RealValue of Natural Capital based on the ecological polygon.

### Lapsed Slips and Policies

There is also a section for Slips and Policies that did not become ensured. This could happen for a variety of reasons including but not limited to owner/seller change of mind/heart, buyer competition, alternative land use, no underwriter or Ensurer, financial feasibility, risk, etc.

## Purpose and Participation

BASIN emphasizes ecological preservation through active participation, aiming to bolster biodiversity and ecosystem services. The purchase of Certificates of Ensurance allows stakeholders to directly contribute to the maintenance of ecological integrity, enhancing [Nature's Balance Sheet](https://docs.basin.global/protocol/natures-balance-sheet).
